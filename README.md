# OcelotWithCustumJWTAuthorization

This project uses Ocelot as a ApiGateway and benefits from JWT authentication and OcelotPipelineConfiguration to customize authentication & authorization pipline in ocelot.

There is a some [misleading HTTP response in this project](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68697948/how-to-return-unauthorized-response-while-overriding-authorizationmiddleware-in) that I hope I can sole it.

I hope enjoy.
